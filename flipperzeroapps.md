The Flipper Zero's capabilities can be significantly extended through the installation of applications, often referred to as FAP (Flipper App Package) files. These applications are developed by both the official Flipper Devices team and the wider community, offering a diverse range of tools, games, and utilities that go beyond the core functionalities provided by the firmware.

Users can discover and install Flipper Zero applications from various sources:

-   **Official Flipper Zero App Store**: Accessible through the Flipper Mobile App and the Flipper Lab website, this is the primary source for verified applications that have undergone certain levels of testing and review. It is generally considered the safest and most reliable source for applications.
    
-   **Unofficial App Stores**: Several community-driven app stores, such as FlipC, have emerged to offer a broader selection of applications, including those that may not meet the criteria for inclusion in the official store. While these stores can provide access to a wider variety of tools, the quality and reliability of the applications can vary.
    
-   **GitHub Repositories**: Many developers within the Flipper Zero community host their application projects on GitHub. This allows users to directly download compiled FAP files or even build the applications from the source code, offering the greatest level of flexibility and transparency. However, this method might require more technical expertise.
    

The installation process for Flipper Zero applications typically involves using the official QFlipper desktop application to upload FAP files to the device's SD card. Additionally, both the official and some unofficial app stores offer direct installation features that streamline the process.
